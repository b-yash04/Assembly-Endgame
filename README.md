# Assembly Endgame

**Assembly Endgame** is a programming-themed twist on the classic Hangman game.  
Your mission: Save the world of high-level programming before Assembly Language takes over.

## Concept

In this game, you’re equipped with 8 popular programming languages as your last line of defense.  
Each wrong guess causes one language to vanish.  
When all 8 are gone, Assembly Language rises as the 9th — and final — fallback.

Guess all letters of the secret word correctly before Assembly takes over.

## Gameplay

- You’re given a word to guess (letter by letter).
- You have 8 languages as lives (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).
- Each incorrect guess removes one language.
- If all letters are guessed correctly in time — you win.
- If all 8 languages vanish, Assembly Language takes control — and you lose.
